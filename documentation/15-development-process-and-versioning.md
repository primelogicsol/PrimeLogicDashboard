## Version Numbering Convention

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
The Prime Logic Dashboard follows semantic versioning with the format: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

- **MAJOR**: Incremented for incompatible API changes or significant UI overhauls
- **MINOR**: Incremented for backward-compatible functionality addition
- **PATCH**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes

### Version Examples
- **1.0.0**: Initial production release
- **1.1.0**: Added new features (e.g., enhanced reporting)
- **1.1.1**: Bug fixes to existing features
- **2.0.0**: Major redesign or architecture change

### Pre-release Identifiers
- **Alpha**: Early development (e.g., 1.2.0-alpha.1)
- **Beta**: Feature complete but may contain bugs (e.g., 1.2.0-beta.1)
- **RC**: Release candidates (e.g., 1.2.0-rc.1)

## Release Cycles

### Sprint Structure
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Planning**: Day 1 of sprint
- **Daily Standups**: Every workday
- **Sprint Review**: Last day of sprint
- **Retrospective**: Last day of sprint

### Release Types
1. **Patch Releases**: Every 1-2 weeks as needed
2. **Minor Releases**: Every 4-6 weeks
3. **Major Releases**: Every 6-12 months

### Hotfix Process
- Critical bugs bypass regular sprint cycle
- Deployed as soon as fixed and tested
- Incorporated into the next patch version

  - User activity logging
  - Permission management refinement

- **Project Management Basics**: 4-6 weeks
  - Project status tracking
  - Basic milestone management
  - File attachment system

### Medium-term (4-6 months)
- **Advanced Project Features**: 6-8 weeks
  - Gantt chart visualization
  - Resource allocation
  - Budget tracking

- **Communication System**: 4-5 weeks
  - In-app messaging
  - Notification preferences
  - Email integration

- **Reporting System**: 5-6 weeks
  - Custom report builder
  - Scheduled reports
  - Export functionality

### Long-term (7-12 months)
- **Payment System**: 8-10 weeks
  - Multiple payment methods
  - Automated invoicing
  - Payment tracking

- **Mobile Application**: 12-16 weeks
  - Core functionality
  - Push notifications
  - Offline capabilities

- **AI Features**: 10-12 weeks
  - Smart matching algorithm
  - Automated responses
  - Predictive analytics

## Feature Prioritization

### Priority Levels
1. **Critical**: Must-have features for system functionality
2. **High**: Important features that provide significant value
3. **Medium**: Valuable features but not immediately necessary
4. **Low**: Nice-to-have features for future consideration

### Prioritization Matrix
| Feature | Business Value | Technical Complexity | User Impact | Priority |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| 2FA Authentication | High | Medium | High | Critical |
| Real-time Chat | Medium | High | High | High |
| Custom Reports | High | Medium | Medium | High |
| AI Matching | Medium | High | Medium | Medium |
| Dark Mode | Low | Low | Low | Low |

### MoSCoW Method
For each release, features are categorized as:
- **Must Have**: Critical for release
- **Should Have**: Important but release not dependent on them
- **Could Have**: Desirable if time permits
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for current release

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Levels
1. **Unit Testing**: Throughout development
2. **Integration Testing**: After feature completion
3. **System Testing**: Before release candidate
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: During beta phase

### Testing Timeline
- **Alpha Testing**: Internal QA (1-2 weeks per minor release)
- **Beta Testing**: Selected users (2-3 weeks per major release)
- **Performance Testing**: Before each major release (1 week)
- **Security Testing**: Quarterly and before major releases

## Deployment Process

### Environments
1. **Development**: Continuous integration
2. **Testing**: After passing CI tests
3. **Staging**: Mirror of production for final testing
4. **Production**: Live environment

### Deployment Schedule
- **Patch Releases**: Can be deployed during off-hours on weekdays
- **Minor Releases**: Weekend deployments with rollback window
- **Major Releases**: Scheduled maintenance windows with extended testing

### Deployment Steps
1. Code freeze (24 hours before deployment)
2. Final QA approval
3. Database backup
4. Deployment to production
5. Smoke testing
6. Monitoring period (24-48 hours)

## Documentation Updates

### Documentation Types
1. **API Documentation**: Updated with each API change
2. **User Guides**: Updated with each minor/major release
3. **Admin Documentation**: Updated with each feature affecting administration
4. **Developer Documentation**: Updated continuously

### Documentation Timeline
- Update technical documentation 1 week before release
- Update user documentation 2 weeks before release
- Review all documentation quarterly

## Version Control Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/xxx**: Individual feature branches
- **release/x.x.x**: Release preparation branches
- **hotfix/xxx**: Emergency fix branches

### Code Review Process
1. Developer creates pull request
2. Code review by at least one peer
3. Automated tests must pass
4. Tech lead approval required
5. Merge to appropriate branch

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Triggers
- Critical bugs affecting core functionality
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds

### Rollback Process
1. Decision made by tech lead/project manager
2. Revert to previous stable version
3. Database rollback if necessary
4. Notify affected users
5. Post-mortem analysis
