## Sprint Structure

### Sprint Duration
- **Standard Sprint**: 2 weeks
- **Planning Sprint**: 1 week (before major release)
- **Bug Fix Sprint**: 1 week (as needed)

### Sprint Team Composition
- **Product Owner**: Prioritizes backlog, defines acceptance criteria
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates process, removes impediments
- **Developers**: Implement features, fix bugs
- **QA Engineers**: Test functionality, report issues
- **UX/UI Designers**: Create designs, support implementation

### Sprint Ceremonies
- **Sprint Planning**: Day 1, 2-3 hours
- **Daily Standup**: Every day, 15 minutes
- **Backlog Refinement**: Mid-sprint, 1-2 hours
- **Sprint Review**: Last day, 1 hour
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Last day, 1 hour

## Sprint Planning Process

### Pre-Planning Activities
1. **Backlog Grooming**: Product owner ensures stories are ready
2. **Priority Assessment**: Stories ranked by business value
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify dependencies between stories
4. **Capacity Planning**: Calculate team capacity for sprint

### Planning Meeting Agenda
1. **Sprint Goal Definition**: Clear objective for the sprint
2. **Story Selection**: Choose stories from prioritized backlog
3. **Story Breakdown**: Break down into tasks
4. **Effort Estimation**: Story point assignment
5. **Capacity Confirmation**: Ensure work matches capacity
6. **Commitment**: Team commits to sprint backlog

### Definition of Ready
Stories must have:
- Clear description
- Defined acceptance criteria
- Design assets (if applicable)
- Technical requirements
- Estimated effort
- No blocking dependencies

## Sprint Execution

### Daily Workflow
1. **Daily Standup**: Status update and impediment identification
2. **Development Work**: Implementation of tasks
3. **Code Review**: Peer review of completed work
4. **QA Testing**: Verification of functionality
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

### Task States
- **To Do**: Not yet started
